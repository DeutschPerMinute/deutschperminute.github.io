    "bio": "Hallo! I’m Aqsa, your German tutor (and yes, German grammar can make sense). I studied German at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, and am currently pursuing my Master’s in German there. I am TestDaF certified and teach German up to C1 level concepts without unnecessary confusion or textbook overload. My classes are structured and interactive, focused on real progress like speaking with confidence, understanding grammar instead of memorizing it, and actually enjoying the process. I teach using an iPad based method with clear notes and explanations, because messy screenshots are not a learning strategy. If you are serious about learning German and slightly tired of overcomplicated explanations, you are in the right place.",
